SafeFolder is a lightweight, open source and cross-platform application that focuses in securing your device through advanced and cutting edge technology.

## Why

This app was developed to help people secure mobile devices such as pendrives and external hard drives. These devices normally are unsecure and if are stolen the attacker 
can access all the data inside. **SafeFolder** comes in these situations, encrypting all your data with only using a password to do so. Your password is also safe because
we use a very secure method called _hashing_, that prevents attackers from reverse engineering to get your password.

> _"You couldn't be any safer!"_
